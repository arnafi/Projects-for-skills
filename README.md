# Projects-for-skills
This folder is for increase skills of Programming.
There is some easy projects for icrease skills of programming.

1st Project is employee managment system:


• Enter ‘r’, to take salary of all employees into “salary” array of size N.

• Enter ‘s’, to search a salary amount. If found, display the index. If not found, display “Not found”.

• Enter ‘t’, to display salary of all employees in reverse index order.

• Enter ‘q’, to quit/exit the menu system.

• For any other input, display “Invalid Input.”

 

 

After the menu is displayed, the program will prompt the user “Enter your choice: “ to enter a choice from the menu. After user enters his choice, the program will act according to the menu choice mentioned above.

That means, if user enters ‘r’, your program will take batting scores into the “runs” array from keyboard. If user enters ‘s’, it will search a salary amount. If found, display the index. If not found, display “Not found”. For choices ‘s’ and ‘t’, the program needs to check whether salary of all employees are already populated into “salary” array or not. If not populated, it will display “No salary information is found”. Please populate your salary information first.

The source code for Customer Account Bank Management System is relatively short and easy to understand. I have divided this C mini project into many functions, most of which are related to different banking activities. Listed below are some of the more important functions which may help you understand the project better.

menu() – This function displays the menu or welcome screen to perform different banking activities mentioned below.


 
new_acc() – This function creates a new customer account. It asks for some  personal and banking details of the customer such as name, date of birth, citizenship number, address and phone number. You can enter the amount to deposit and cashout.
