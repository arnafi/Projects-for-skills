This folder is for increase skills of Programming.
There is some easy projects for icrease skills of programming.

1st Project is employee managment system:


• Enter ‘r’, to take salary of all employees into “salary” array of size N.

• Enter ‘s’, to search a salary amount. If found, display the index. If not found, display “Not found”.

• Enter ‘t’, to display salary of all employees in reverse index order.

• Enter ‘q’, to quit/exit the menu system.

• For any other input, display “Invalid Input.”

 

 

After the menu is displayed, the program will prompt the user “Enter your choice: “ to enter a choice from the menu. After user enters his choice, the program will act according to the menu choice mentioned above.

That means, if user enters ‘r’, your program will take batting scores into the “runs” array from keyboard. If user enters ‘s’, it will search a salary amount. If found, display the index. If not found, display “Not found”. For choices ‘s’ and ‘t’, the program needs to check whether salary of all employees are already populated into “salary” array or not. If not populated, it will display “No salary information is found”. Please populate your salary information first.
